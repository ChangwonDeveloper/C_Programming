/*
plays tic-tac-toe
    played on a 3*3 grid the game is played by two players, who take turns
you should create an array to represent the board
    can be of type char and consist of 10 elements (do not use zero)
    each element represents a coordinate on the board that the user can select
some functions that you should probably create
    checkForWin - checks to see if a player has won or the game is a draw
    drawBoard - redraws the board for each player turn
    markBoard sets the char arrays with a selection and check for an invalid selection

    // Check win

    // Check draw

    // if it is not above situation, continue to getting input from user.....
